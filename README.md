# filehandling
EXPLANATION:                                                                                                                                                                                                   This Java program demonstrates basic file handling using FileWriter, BufferedWriter, FileReader, and BufferedReader to write and read employee data to and from a file named employees.txt. The program begins in the main method, where it first calls writeToFile() to save hardcoded employee records in a comma-separated format. It uses BufferedWriter to write each employeeâ€™s ID, name, department, designation, and salary to the file, placing each record on a new line. After writing the data, the program calls readFromFile() to read and display the contents of the file. This method uses BufferedReader to read the file line by line, splits each line into fields using the comma as a delimiter, and then prints the employee information in a well-formatted table. The use of buffered streams improves performance, and the try-with-resources syntax ensures that file resources are closed automatically. This program provides a simple and clear example of file input/output operations in Java and how data can be structured, stored, and retrieved efficiently.
